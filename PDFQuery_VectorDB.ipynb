Once you have finished reading the publication, \\nwe ask that you kindly give us your feedback by responding to this short survey . Your input \\nis highly appreciated.2023 was the warmest year on record at 1.45 ± 0.12 °C above the pre-industrial \\naverage. \\nConcentrations of the three main greenhouse gases – carbon \\ndioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide – reached record high \\nobserved levels.\\nGlobal mean sea level reached a record high. The rate of \\nsea level rise in the past ten years (2014–2023) has more \\nthan doubled since the first decade of the satellite record \\n(1993–2002). \\nAntarctic sea-ice extent reached an absolute record \\nlow in February. The annual maximum extent was \\naround 1\\xa0million km2 below the previous record low \\nmaximum.\\nPreliminary data from the global set of reference \\nglaciers for the hydrological year 2022-2023 show \\nthey experienced the largest loss of ice on record \\n(1950–2023), driven by extremely negative mass \\nbalance in both western North America and Europe.\\nGlaciers in Switzerland lost around 10% of their remaining \\nvolume in the past two years.\\nExtreme weather continued to lead to severe socio-economic \\nimpacts. Extreme heat affected many parts of the world. \\nWildfires in Hawaii, Canada and Europe led to loss of life, the \\ndestruction of homes and large-scale air pollution. Flooding \\nassociated with extreme rainfall from Mediterranean Cyclone \\nDaniel affected Greece, Bulgaria, Türkiye, and Libya with \\nparticularly heavy loss of life in Libya.\\nFood security, population displacement and impacts on vulnerable \\npopulations continue to be of mounting concern in 2023, with weather \\nand climate hazards exacerbating the situation in many parts of the world.Ocean heat content reached its highest level in the 65-year \\nobservational record.Key messagesiiiThe World Meteorological Organization State \\nof the Global Climate report confirms that the \\nyear 2023 broke every single climate indicator. \\nIt was by far the warmest year on record. \\nThe global average temperature in 2023 was \\n1.45 ± 0.12 °C above the 1850–1900 average. \\nNever have we been so close – albeit on a \\ntemporary basis – to the 1.5° C lower limit of \\nthe Paris Agreement on climate change.\\nConcentrations of greenhouse gases continued \\nto rise. Ocean heat content and sea level reached \\nrecord observed highs, and the rate of increase \\nis accelerating. Antarctic sea ice extent hit \\nrecord observed lows. Key glaciers suffered \\nrecord losses. \\nThe climate crisis is the defining challenge that humanity faces. \\nHeatwaves, floods, droughts, wildfires and intense tropical cyclones wreaked havoc on every \\ncontinent and caused huge socio-economic losses. There were particularly devastating \\nconsequences for vulnerable populations who suffer disproportionate impacts. \\nExtreme climate conditions exacerbated humanitarian crises, with millions experiencing acute \\nfood insecurity and hundreds of thousands displaced from their homes.\\nWMO is committed to stepping up collaboration with the international community to confront \\nthe enormity of this challenge. \\nWMO and its Members are expanding life-saving early warning services to achieve the \\nground-breaking Early Warnings For All initiative. A new Global Greenhouse Gas Watch seeks \\nto provide scientifically-based information for climate change mitigation. The transition to \\nrenewable energy must be supported by tailor-made weather and climate services.\\nTo succeed, it is imperative to leverage efforts across the entire value chain—from improving \\nclimate data and monitoring, strengthening prediction and projections, and building capacity. \\nWe must make climate information more accessible and actionable to serve society.\\nI hope this report will raise awareness of the vital need to scale up the urgency and ambition \\nof climate action.\\nI take this opportunity to congratulate and thank the experts and lead authors who compiled this \\nreport. I extend my gratitude to all the contributors, National Meteorological and Hydrological \\nServices and Regional Climate Centres and United Nations agencies. Foreword\\n(Prof. Celeste Saulo)\\nSecretary-General1\\nThe global climate indicators provide an overview of changes in the climate system.1 The\\xa0set \\nof interlinked physical indicators presented here connect the changing composition of the \\natmosphere with changes in energy in the climate system and the response of land, ocean, \\nand ice.\\nThe global indicators are based on a wide range of data sets which comprise data from \\nmultiple observing systems including satellites and in situ networks (for details on data sets \\nused in the report, see Data set and methods ).\\nChanges to the physical climate, measured here by key indicators, can have cascading \\nimpacts on national development and progress toward the UN Sustainable Development \\nGoals (SDGs).2 For example, changes in the acidity or temperature of the ocean can affect \\nmarine life, potentially impacting coastal communities that may depend on the local catch \\nfor their livelihood or food security. On the other hand, climate science has a critical role to \\nplay in facilitating sustainable development. As demonstrated by the 2023 United in Science \\nreport, weather, climate, and water-related sciences support the achievement of many of the \\nSDGs.3 Recognizing the interconnections between climate and development can therefore \\nlead to synergistic action—an increasing necessity as the world gets further off-track from \\nachieving both the SDGs and the Paris Agreement goals.4\\nBASELINES\\nBaselines are periods of time, usually spanning three decades or more, that are used as a\\xa0fixed \\nbenchmark against which current conditions can be compared. For scientific, policy and \\npractical reasons, several different baselines are used in this report, and these are specified \\nin the text and figures. Where possible, the most recent WMO climatological standard normal, \\n1991–2020, is used for consistent reporting.\\nFor some indicators, however, it is not possible to use the standard normal owing to a lack of \\nmeasurements during the early part of the period. There are also two specific exceptions. First, \\nfor the global mean temperature time series – and only for the global mean series – a\\xa0reference \\nperiod of 1850–1900 is used. This is the baseline used in IPCC AR6 WG\\xa0I as a reference period \\nfor pre-industrial conditions and is relevant for understanding progress in the context of the \\nParis Agreement. Second, greenhouse gas concentrations can be estimated much further \\nback in time using gas bubbles trapped in ice cores. Therefore, the year\\xa01750 is used in this \\nreport to represent pre-industrial greenhouse gas concentrations.Global climate indicators2\\nGREENHOUSE GASES\\nConcentrations of the three main greenhouse gases – carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide – \\nreached record high observed levels in 2022, the latest year for which consolidated global values are \\navailable (1984–2022). Real-time data from specific locations show that levels of the three greenhouse \\ngases continued to increase in\\xa02023.\\nAtmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases reflect a balance between emissions from \\nhuman activities, natural sources, and sinks. Increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the \\natmosphere due to human activities have been the major driver of climate change since the \\nindustrial revolution. Global average mole fractions of greenhouse gases – referred to\\xa0here \\nfor\\xa0simplicity as the “concentration” in the atmosphere – are calculated from in situ obser -\\nvations made at multiple sites through the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) Programme of \\nWMO and partner networks.\\nIn 2022 – the latest year for which consolidated global figures are available – atmospheric \\nlevels of greenhouse gases reached new observed highs (Figure\\xa01), with globally averaged \\nconcentrations for carbon dioxide\\xa0(CO2) at 417.9\\xa0±\\xa00.2\\xa0parts\\xa0per\\xa0million\\xa0(ppm), methane\\xa0(CH4) \\nat\\xa01923\\xa0±\\xa02\\xa0parts\\xa0per\\xa0billion\\xa0(ppb) and nitrous oxide\\xa0(N2O) at 335.8\\xa0±\\xa00.1\\xa0ppb, respectively\\xa0150%, \\n264% and 124% of pre-industrial (1750) levels.

The imbalance leads to an accumulation of energy in the Earth system in the form of heat \\nthat is driving global warming.10,11 The ocean, which covers around 70% of the Earth’s surface, \\nabsorbs heat and CO2, which can act to slow the rate of warming in the atmosphere. However, \\nthe heat absorbed by the ocean leads to ocean warming which, together with the melting of ice \\non land, raises sea levels. The ocean also absorbs CO2 leading to ocean acidification. Warming \\nwaters, sea level rise and ocean acidification all have significant effects on the ocean, as well \\nas the plants and animals that live in it and the people who rely upon it for their livelihoods.\\nOCEAN HEAT CONTENT\\nIn 2023, ocean heat content reached its highest level in the 65-year observational\\xa0record.\\nAround 90% of the energy that has accumulated in the Earth system since 1971 is stored in \\nthe ocean. As energy has accumulated in the ocean, it has warmed and the heat content of \\nthe ocean (Ocean Heat Content, Figure\\xa04) has increased.\\nAccording to a consolidated analysis based on several individual datasets, the upper 2000\\xa0m \\nof the ocean continued to warm in 2023.12 It is expected that warming will continue – a change \\nwhich is irreversible on centennial to millennial timescales.13,14 Ocean heat content in 2023 \\nwas the highest on record, exceeding the 2022 value by 13\\xa0 ±\\xa09\\xa0ZJ ( Figure\\xa04)  consistent with \\nestimates published early in 2024.15 \\nAll data sets agree that ocean warming rates show a particularly strong increase in the past \\ntwo decades.

The steady increase of ocean warming rates16,17 is seen consistently in direct \\nestimates from in situ observations, indirect estimates from remote sensing, and direct estimate \\nof the net flux at the top of the atmosphere as measured by satellites.18 Different drivers of \\nthis change are discussed in literature, including a change in anthropogenic climate forcing19 \\nand natural variability.20 Deep-ocean global warming below 2000\\xa0m depth is estimated to be \\n0.07\\xa0±\\xa00.03\\xa0W·m-2 from 1992–2022.21\\n0.50\\n0.25\\n0\\n–0.25–0.50–0.75–1.00–1.25OHC (J/m2)\\n1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020\\nYearx 109\\nvon Schuckmann et al., 2023\\nIAP , Cheng et al., 2017JMA, Ishii et al., 2017Minière et al., 2023   Figure 4.

The Southern Ocean domain is the largest reservoir of heat, \\naccounting for23 around 32% of the global OHC increase in the upper 2000 \\xa0m since 1958. The \\nAtlantic Ocean accounts for approximately 31% of the global 0–2000 \\xa0m OHC increase; the \\nPacific Ocean around 26%.\\nSome relatively small regions are cooling, including the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean \\nextending from near the surface down to a depth of over 800 \\xa0m (also the only area to show \\ncentennial cooling at the surface). The contrasting pattern of cooling (50°N –70° N) and \\nwarming (20°N –50°N) in the North Atlantic has been associated with a slowing of the Atlantic \\nMeridional Overturning Circulation and local interactions between the air and sea.24 Other \\ncooling regions include the northwest Pacific, southwest Pacific and southwest Indian Oceans.\\nSEA LEVEL\\nIn 2023, global mean sea level reached a record high in the satellite record (1993\\xa0to\\xa0present), reflecting \\ncontinued ocean warming as well as the melting of glaciers and ice\\xa0sheets.\\nThe rate of global mean sea level rise in the past ten years (2014–2023) is more than twice the rate \\nof sea level rise in the first decade of the satellite record (1993–2002).\\nGlobal mean sea level (GMSL) continued to rise in 2023 (Figure\\xa06 ). The La\\xa0Niña conditions \\nbetween mid-2020 and early 2023 had only a small apparent effect on GMSL, unlike the 2011 \\nLa\\xa0Niña that led to a temporary decrease in the GMSL of several millimetres.

This is characteristic of warm seawater in the \\nregion associated with ENSO-neutral conditions. Sea levels in the North Atlantic and eastern \\ntropical Pacific were lower than the long-term average. Warming of the surface waters in the \\neastern tropical Pacific during the early stages of the 2023 El\\xa0Niño (see Short-term climate \\ndrivers ) led to an increase in sea level relative to the long-term mean in the most eastern part \\nof the tropical Pacific between April and June. By July to September, the El\\xa0Niño signature \\nwas clearly visible, with sea level being above average from the mid-tropical Pacific to the \\ncoasts of central and South America. Above average sea levels were also observed in the \\ntropical and north-east Atlantic, associated with the anomalous warming in these areas during \\nNorthern Hemisphere summer. From October to the end of the year, the El\\xa0Niño pattern \\ncontinued to develop. The shift to the positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole also led to \\nhigher-than-average sea level in the western Indian Ocean and lower-than-average sea levels \\nin the east (see Short-term climate drivers ).\\n60°N\\n30°N\\n30°S\\n60°S\\n60°N\\n30°N\\n30°S\\n60°S60°E            180°           60°W     0°0°\\n0°\\n60°E            180°            60°W     0°January–February–March average\\nJuly–August–September average\\n60°N\\n0°30°N\\n30°S\\n60°S\\n60°N\\n30°N\\n30°S\\n60°S60°E             180°            60°W     0°\\n60°E             180°            60°W     0°0°April–May–June average\\nOctober–November–December average\\n–0.3              –0.2                –0.1                0.0                 0.1                0.2                 0.3  (m)\\nFigure 7.  3-month averages of altimetry-based sea level anomalies (relative to the 1993–2012 average, which is the product \\nclimatology) for January to March 2023 (top left), April to June 2023 (top right), July to September 2023 (bottom left) and October \\nto December 2023 (bottom right). \\nSource:  Data downloaded from the Copernicus Marine Service (CMEMS, https://marine.copernicus.eu ).

Satellite retrievals of sea-surface temperature \\nare used to monitor MHWs and MCSs globally, categorized here as moderate , strong , severe , \\nextreme, or ice (for definitions, see Data set and methods ).\\nEl\\xa0Niño events tend to cause wide-spread MHWs in the eastern Tropical Pacific. While this region \\ndid experience strong  MHWs in 2023 to late October (Figure\\xa08a ), and moderate  for the rest of \\n2023, the overall areal coverage was smaller in area than it was in previous El\\xa0Niño\\xa0events.\\nFigure 8.

Ocean acidification affects \\norganisms and ecosystem services, including food security, by reducing biodiversity, \\ndegrading habitats, and endangering fisheries and aquaculture.29 The IPCC AR6 concluded \\nthat “There is very high confidence that open ocean surface pH is now the lowest it has been \\nfor at least\\xa026\\xa0[thousand years] and current rates of pH change are unprecedented since at \\nleast that time”.30\\nAlthough global efforts, many supported by IOC-UNESCO and led by the Global Ocean \\nAcidification Observing Network and its UN Ocean Decade Programme – Ocean Acidification \\nResearch for Sustainability, have resulted in an increase in the number of ocean acidification \\nobservations, many regions remain under-sampled. Data collected for the Sustainable \\nDevelopment Goal 14.3.1 Indicator (“Average marine acidity (pH) measured at agreed suite of \\nrepresentative sampling stations”) show that the current coverage is inadequate (Figure\\xa011 ), \\nwith time series not long enough to determine trends and gaps in observations in all areas. \\nGlobal trends illustrating the decrease of the global pH (Figure\\xa010 ) show the large-scale \\neffects of CO2 emissions. However, the rate of change in ocean acidification, and its pattern \\nand scale, show great regional and temporal variability and understanding these requires \\nhigh-resolution, long-term observation at scales relevant to the affected communities. \\nFigure 11.

The total mass balance (TMB) of an ice sheet is the sum of three \\ncomponents: the surface mass balance (SMB), the marine mass balance (MMB), and the basal \\nmass balance (BMB). The SMB is the difference between snow accumulation and meltwater \\nrunoff from the ice sheet. The MMB is the mass loss at the edge of the ice sheet from the \\ncalving of icebergs and the melting of ice that is in contact with the ocean. BMB consists \\nof melting at the ice sheet bed due to geothermal heat and friction as the ice slides over \\nthe ground beneath. A\\xa0negative mass balance indicates a loss of ice mass; a positive mass \\nbalance indicates a gain.Cryosphere13\\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet continued to lose mass in the hydrological year 2022–2023 \\n(1\\xa0September 2022 to 31 August 2023) based on estimates from an ensemble of regional \\nclimate models.41 Annual snow accumulation over Greenland still exceeds surface melt in \\nmost years, giving a\\xa0positive SMB. For 2022–2023 this was estimated at +317\\xa0Gt, below \\nthe long-term average but well above the extreme melt years of 2011–2012 and 2018–2019. \\nCombined with BMB (−27\\xa0Gt) and MMB (−504\\xa0Gt), the estimated 2022–2023 ice sheet total \\nmass balance was about −217 \\xa0Gt.\\nThe summer 2023 melt season was relatively intense, punctuated by major heat waves in \\nJuly and August.42 Satellite melt-extent data indicate that the ice sheet had the third highest \\ncumulative melt-day area43 on record (1978–2023), after the extreme melt season of 2012 and \\n2010 (Figure\\xa014 ). It was the warmest summer on record (1987-present) at the Summit station, \\n3.4\\xa0°C warmer than the 1991–2020 average and 1.0\\xa0°C warmer than the previous record.44 \\nSummit station experienced melting conditions for the fifth year on record (2012, 2019, 2021, \\n2022, 2023); ice core records indicate that significant, melting conditions last happened in \\nthe late nineteenth century.45\\nThe Ice Sheet Mass Balance Intercomparison Exercise (IMBIE) has documented the acceleration \\nin combined mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets over the period of the \\nsatellite record, 1992–2020.46 The average Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheet TMBs over this \\nperiod were −169 and −92 \\xa0Gigatonnes per year (Gt ·yr-1), respectively, and −261 \\xa0Gt·yr-1 combined. \\nCombining the two ice sheets, the seven highest melt years on record are all since 2010, \\nand average rates of mass loss increased from 105 Gt ·yr-1 from 1992–1996 to 372 \\xa0Gt·yr-1 from \\n2016–2020.

The Antarctic ice sheet gained 122\\xa0Gt over this same period.\\nGLACIERS\\nPreliminary data indicate the annual mass balance of a global set of reference glaciers for the \\nhydrological year 2022-2023 was –1.2 m w.e. This is nominally the largest loss of ice on record \\n(1950-2023), driven by extremely negative mass balance in both western North America and Europe.\\nGlaciers in western North America and the European Alps experienced an extreme melt season. In \\nSwitzerland, glaciers lost around 10% of their remaining volume in the past two years. \\nGlaciers are formed from snow that has compacted to form ice, which then deforms and flows \\ndownhill. Glaciers comprise two zones: an accumulation zone where accumulation of mass \\nfrom snowfall exceeds ice loss, and an ablation zone where ice loss (ablation) from melting \\nand other mechanisms exceeds accumulation. Where glaciers end in a lake or the ocean, ice \\nloss can occur through melting where the ice meets the water, and via calving when chunks \\nof the glacier break off.\\nGlacier mass balance – the amount of mass gained or lost by the glacier – is commonly \\nexpressed as the annual thickness change averaged over the glacier area, expressed in \\nmetres of water equivalent (m w.e.).47 Melt rates are strongly affected by the glacier albedo, \\nthe fraction of sunlight that is reflected by the glacier surface. Exposed glacier ice is darker \\nand therefore has a lower albedo than the seasonal snowpack and is sensitive to darkening \\nfrom mineral dust, black carbon, algal activity, and fallout from forest fires. Reduced snow \\ncover, long melt seasons, and wildfire activity all serve to concentrate darker material on the \\nglacier surface, decreasing its albedo and thereby increasing the melt.\\n3000\\n20001000\\n0\\n–1000–2000–3000Ice mass (Gt)\\n2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024\\nYear Year15001000\\n500\\n0\\n–500\\n–1000–1500Ice mass (Gt)Greenland ice sheet Antarctic ice sheet\\n2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024\\nFigure 15.

In 2023, renewable capacity additions \\nincreased by almost 50% from 2022, for a total of 510\\xa0gigawatts (GW). 54 Such growth marks the highest rate \\nobserved in the past two decades and, as the International Energy Agency (IEA) indicates, demonstrates \\nthe potential to achieve the clean energy goal set at COP28 to triple renewable energy capacity globally to \\nreach 11\\xa0000 GW by 2030.55 \\nIn the era of this massive and fast transition to renewables, understanding the critical nexus between climate \\nvariability and renewable energy is pivotal. A comprehensive knowledge of how the climate is going to mod -\\nulate the availability of and demand for renewable energy is essential for optimizing operation, investments \\nand planning of energy resources. The recent joint publication of WMO and International Renewable Energy \\nAgency (IRENA) on Climate-driven Global Renewable Energy Potential Resources and Energy Demand in 2022 \\n(WMO-IRENA 2023) underscores the inherent links between renewable energy resources and weather and \\nclimate conditions. The report emphasizes the potential for developing countries, especially in Africa where \\nenergy access remains a key priority, to develop clean energy systems and urges better accounting for climate \\nvariability for improved operation, management and planning of energy resources.\\nThe importance of accounting for climate variability can be seen in Figure 21 , which shows monthly energy \\nsupply and demand anomalies in Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe in 2022 \\nrelative to the average of the 1991-2020 reference period. The anomalies are measured by four defined energy \\nindicators, which are capacity factors56 for wind power (WP), Solar PV (SPV), Weighted total precipitation (WTP) \\nas a hydropower proxy indicator, and Energy Degree Days (EDD) as a proxy for energy demand indicator. \\nTo illustrate how the plots can be interpreted, \\nconsider October when demand in all five \\ncountries is between 5% and 30% higher than \\naverage, while a large portion of potential \\ngeneration is lower than average (except for \\nsmall increases in SPV for Mozambique and \\nZimbabwe, and WP for Zimbabwe). In this \\nsituation, balancing power would require \\ncareful planning, for instance to ensure there \\nis enough water in hydropower dams from \\nthe previous rainy season (typically ending \\nin May), and ahead of the next rainy season \\n(typically starting in October–November).\\nFor more detailed information about the \\nindicators and additional insights on other \\nregions and global results, refer to the main \\npublication .57\\nJan       Feb     Mar     Apr     May      Jun      Jul      Aug      Sep      Oct      Nov      Dec60\\n4020\\n0\\n–20–40–60WP (%)\\nJan       Feb     Mar     Apr     May      Jun      Jul      Aug      Sep      Oct      Nov      Dec302010\\n0\\n–10–20–30SVP (%)\\n150100\\n50\\n0\\n–50\\n–100–150WTP (%)\\n604020\\n0\\n–20–40–60EDD (%)Botswana Mozambique Namibia South Africa Zimbabwe\\nFigure 20.

As a result, the formation of the Antarctic ozone hole \\ncontinues to be an annual spring event with year-to-year variation in its size and depth governed \\nto a large degree by meteorological conditions. The “hole” is not strictly speaking a hole; it \\nis an area where the total column ozone in the stratosphere falls below 220 Dobson units.59\\nIn 2023, the development of the ozone hole had an unusually early start, becoming the 6th\\xa0largest \\nin the satellite era. It expanded to 26\\xa0million\\xa0km2 on 21\\xa0September, comparable with the two \\nprevious years (2021 and 2022) and close to the maxima observed in earlier years such as \\n28.2\\xa0million\\xa0km2 in 2015 and 29.6\\xa0million\\xa0km2 in 2006 according to analyses from the National \\nAeronautics and Space Administration60 (NASA) and Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring \\nService61 (CAMS). NASA reported a minimum ozone of 99\\xa0DU on 3\\xa0October 2023. Despite \\nthe area of the ozone hole decreasing in a typical manner through early October, it increased \\nagain towards the end of the month and remained at or above approximately 15\\xa0million\\xa0km2 \\nuntil the first week of December. Although the ozone hole was unusually long-lived in 2023, \\nits longevity was similar to that of the ozone holes of the last three years.\\n95%\\n75%\\nmedian\\n25%5%Southern Hemisphere ozone column minimum\\n300\\n250\\n200\\n150\\n100\\nDateTotal amount of ozone (DU)\\n July             August            September         October          November         December  96.8\\n July             August            September         October          November         December  \\nDate\\n1979-2020\\n202120222023Forecast25\\n20\\n15\\n10\\n501979-2020\\n202120222023Forecast26.15\\n25\\n20\\n15\\n10\\n50Area (million km2)95%\\n75%\\nmedian\\n25%5%Southern Hemisphere ozone hole area\\nFigure 21.

Several potential \\ndrivers for the observed stronger polar vortex have been identified, including water vapor \\ninjected into the stratosphere by the eruption of Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha’apai, wind patterns \\nin the Southern Hemisphere, and climate change.\\nSHORT-TERM CLIMATE DRIVERS\\nA prolonged period of La\\xa0Niña from mid-2020 to early 2023 gave way to El\\xa0Niño conditions which were \\nwell established by September 2023, contributing to the observed rise in global mean sea-surface \\ntemperatures during 2023.\\nThere are many different natural phenomena, often referred to as climate patterns or climate \\nmodes, that affect weather and climate at timescales ranging from days to several months or \\neven years. In 2023, the El\\xa0Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole, and \\nthe North Atlantic Oscillation, highlighted here, contributed to major weather and climate \\nevents across large areas of the world.\\nENSO – EL\\xa0NIÑO SOUTHERN OSCILLATION\\nENSO is one of the most important climate drivers of year-to-year variability in weather patterns \\nworldwide. It is linked to hazards such as heavy rains, floods, and drought, heatwaves, and \\ncold spells. El\\xa0Niño, characterized by higher-than-average sea-surface temperatures in the \\neastern tropical Pacific and a weakening of the trade winds, typically has a warming influence \\non global temperatures. La\\xa0Niña, which is characterized by below-average sea-surface \\ntemperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific and a strengthening of the trade \\nwinds, has the opposite effect.\\nA multi-year La\\xa0Niña event began in mid-2020 and ended in early 2023. Subsequently, sea-surface \\ntemperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific increased, crossing typical El\\xa0Niño thresholds (0.5\\xa0°C \\nin Figure\\xa022 ) by June. However, the atmosphere was slower to respond, and it was not until \\nearly September that El\\xa0Niño conditions were well established in both the atmosphere and \\nocean. By the end of the year, a strong El\\xa0Niño had developed, with the Oceanic Niño Index \\nreaching 2.0°C for the November-January period, the highest value since the 2015/16 El\\xa0Niño.\\n1950        1960        1970        1980         1990        2000        2010        2020\\nYearTemperature (°C)3\\n210\\n–1–2\\nFigure 22.

Anomalies are with respect to the \\n1991–2020 average sea-surface temperature. \\nSource:  NOAA NCEPShort-term climate drivers21\\nEl\\xa0Ni ño has an influence on regional rainfall patterns. Precipitation anomalies were typical of \\nEl\\xa0Niño in some regions: drier than usual conditions in maritime Southeast Asia and from southern \\nMexico to northern South America and wetter than normal conditions in parts of Chile ( Figure\\xa023 ).\\nDecreased monsoon rainfall in southeast Asia is associated with El\\xa0Niño. Onset of the monsoon \\nover Kerala, India, occurred on 8\\xa0June, 7\\xa0days later than normal. By the end of September, \\nIndia had received 94% of its typical monsoon rainfall.62 Higher than normal rainfall totals, \\nhowever, were observed along the lower course of the Indus River and in central India.\\nIn Australia, La\\xa0Niña is associated with wetter-than-normal conditions and El\\xa0Niño with \\ndrier-than-normal conditions. In January, rainfall for the country was 35% above normal as \\nLa\\xa0Niña wound down, but in August it was 50% below normal with a strengthening El\\xa0Niño. \\nThe\\xa0dryness was also accompanied by the highest July-to-September national mean tem -\\nperatures in Australia’s 114-year record. September was the driest on record in Australia and \\nAugust to October was the driest three-month period in the 124-year observational record. \\nHowever, somewhat atypically for an El\\xa0Niño event, November and December were wetter \\nthan average in much of eastern Australia.\\nAs average global temperature anomalies increased during the transition from La\\xa0Niña to \\nEl\\xa0Niño, many regions also experienced heatwaves, including parts of the United States, Mexico, \\nEurope, North Africa and the Middle East, China, Siberia, and South America. A\\xa0UNEP Frontiers \\nreport63 highlighted that variability associated with EI\\xa0Niño has implications for biomass and \\nfire weather64 which increases the risk of large and intense wildfires in some places. Please \\nrefer to the section on Extreme weather and climate events  for more details on extreme events.\\nIOD – INDIAN OCEAN DIPOLE\\nThe positive phase of the IOD is characterised by below-average sea-surface temperatures \\n(and sea level) in the eastern Indian Ocean and above average sea-surface temperatures (and \\nsea level) in the west. The negative phase has the opposite pattern. The resulting change in \\nthe gradient of sea-surface temperature across the ocean basin affects the weather of the \\nsurrounding continents, primarily in equatorial regions and the Southern Hemisphere. Positive \\nIOD events are often, but not always, associated with El\\xa0Niño and negative events with La\\xa0Niña.\\nIn conjunction with the emergence of El\\xa0Niño, the first positive IOD since 2019 developed \\nin early austral spring and peaked during October. The positive IOD helped to intensify the \\nanomalously dry and warm conditions over parts of Australia during this time. Conversely, \\nrainfall totals in the Horn of Africa during the October–December rainy season were much \\nhigher than normal, leading to flooding in Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya; this follows the \\nprolonged drought in the region from 2020 to early 2023 when La\\xa0Niña conditions and a\\xa0neutral \\nto negative Indian Ocean dipole were largely present.\\nNAO – NORTH ATLANTIC OSCILLATION\\nAverage sea level pressure in the North Atlantic is characterized by an area of lower pressure \\nclose to Iceland known as the Icelandic Low and an area of higher pressure centred over the \\nAzores known as the Azores High. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is based on the sea-level \\npressure difference between the Icelandic Low and the Azores high. It is mainly associated \\nwith driving weather conditions in the North Atlantic basin, Europe, and the Mediterranean. \\nThe positive phase is characterized by below-normal pressure over the North Atlantic high \\nlatitudes and above-normal pressure over the central Atlantic, the eastern United States, Short-term climate drivers22\\nand western Europe. The negative phase has the opposite pattern. Because the phases are \\ndetermined by pressure changes in the atmosphere, they can fluctuate more rapidly, on the \\norder of days to weeks, compared with other climate drivers such as ENSO, which are driven \\nby slower changes in ocean temperature and fluctuate on the order of months to years.\\nHigh pressure associated with the negative NAO in late June and July 2023 contributed to \\na heatwave that caused significant snow and ice melt across southern Greenland. Several \\nwidespread melting events occurred during this period. Ireland reported its warmest June \\non record (124\\xa0years), as did the long-running Uccle station in Belgium (191\\xa0years). In eastern \\nCanada, many locations reported record warmth for July.\\nPRECIPITATION\\nAccumulated precipitation totals in 2023 were above the long-term average ( Figure\\xa023 ) in East \\nand Central Asia and parts of northern Asia; the western Indian summer monsoon region; parts of \\nthe Maritime Continent; northern New Zealand; parts of West, Central, Southern and East Africa; \\nWest, Central and Southeast Europe; southern Scandinavia; the western Middle East; northwest, \\nsouthwest and southeast North America; Greater Antilles; and parts of southeast South America.\\nRegions with a marked rainfall deficit included: southeast South America, the Amazon Basin, \\nand much of Central America; southern Canada; the western Mediterranean region and \\nSouthwest Europe; parts of northwest, central, and southern Africa; parts of central Asia; \\nthe eastern Indian Monsoon region; parts of southeast Asia and the Maritime Continent; \\nsouthwest and coastal north Australia; and many of the Pacific Islands.\\nThe onset of the West African Monsoon was around normal. The Greater Horn of Africa \\nregion, which had been experiencing long-term drought, suffered substantial flooding in 2023, \\nparticularly later in the year as heavy rains associated with El\\xa0Niño and the positive Indian \\nOcean Dipole became established (see Extreme weather and climate events ).\\n180˚                  120˚W                   60˚W                     0˚                      60˚E                  120˚E                   180˚\\nLongitude\\nQuantile0.0               0.2               0.4                0.6               0.8               1.0Latitude90°N\\n45°N\\n0°\\n45°S90°SFigure 23.

In its \\ninitial stages, the storm produced extreme rainfall in Greece, southern Bulgaria, and parts of \\nTürkiye, while at the same time another storm system produced significant flash flooding in \\nSpain with adverse effects on cereal production.67 The heaviest falls were in the Thessaly region \\nof Greece north of Athens, where Zagora Pelion received 760\\xa0mm on 5\\xa0September and a 5-day \\ntotal of 1096\\xa0mm from 4 to 8\\xa0September, while in Bulgaria, 329\\xa0mm fell in 16\\xa0hours at Kosti on \\n4–5\\xa0September. The storm then remained slow-moving in the eastern Mediterranean for several \\ndays before its major rainbands impacted north-eastern Libya on 10 and 11\\xa0September. Extreme \\nrainfalls affected the coast and nearby mountains, with 414\\xa0mm falling in 24\\xa0hours at Al-Bayda \\non 10–11\\xa0September. The intense rainfalls resulted in extreme flooding in the region. The most \\nextreme impacts were in the city of Derna (about 50\\xa0km east of Al-Bayda), where much of the \\ncentral city was destroyed by flooding that was exacerbated by the failure of two dams. At \\nleast 4\\xa0700 confirmed deaths in Libya68 have been attributed to the flooding, with 8\\xa0000 people \\nstill missing (as of 15\\xa0December). There were 19\\xa0additional deaths in Greece69 and Bulgaria.\\nTropical Cyclone Freddy  in February and March was one of the world’s longest-lived tropical \\ncyclones. It formed on 6\\xa0February off the western coast of Australia and, after earlier landfalls \\nin Madagascar and Mozambique, made its final landfall in Mozambique on 11\\xa0March before \\nmoving inland as a remnant low. The major impacts of Freddy  came because of flooding during \\nthe final landfall, both in Mozambique and Malawi, as extremely heavy rain fell (up to 672\\xa0mm \\nduring the storm in Mozambique). Parts of Mozambique and Malawi had not yet recovered \\nfrom storms in 2022. Malawi was especially hard hit with at least 679\\xa0deaths reported and \\nover 659\\xa0000 internal displacements70, with a further 165 deaths in Mozambique.71 Casualties \\nwere also reported in Madagascar and Zimbabwe, and at sea near Mauritius.\\nTropical Cyclone Mocha , in May, was one of the most intense cyclones ever observed in the Bay \\nof Bengal, reaching peak 10-minute sustained winds of 115\\xa0kt. It formed on 11\\xa0May and made \\nlandfall near the Bangladesh-Myanmar border on 14\\xa0May.72 In Bangladesh, displacement was \\nreported in Cox’s Bazar, the world’s largest refugee settlement, which is home to over 900\\xa0000 \\nRohingya refugees from Myanmar.73 More than 29\\xa0000 people were temporarily relocated.74 In total \\nat least 156\\xa0lives were lost in Myanmar75 and over 270\\xa0000\\xa0buildings damaged or destroyed.76 At \\nleast 63\\xa0000\\xa0displacements took place in camps sheltering people already displaced by conflict \\nand violence.77 The effects of Cyclone Mocha , together with an intensification of conflict and \\nrecord high food prices, have severely aggravated acute food insecurity, especially among the \\n3.4\\xa0million vulnerable people assessed as in need of humanitarian assistance.78\\nThe largest reported economic loss from a single event in 2023 was from Hurricane Otis, which \\nhit the Pacific coast of Mexico in late October. Otis reached hurricane intensity at 1200\\xa0UTC on \\n24\\xa0October, and within fifteen hours had intensified to a category 5\\xa0system,79 one of the most Extreme weather and \\nclimate\\xa0events24\\nrapid rates of intensification observed in the satellite era. Shortly afterwards, it made landfall \\njust west of Acapulco at near peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 260\\xa0km·hr-1, \\nwhich might be the first known category 5 landfall on the Pacific coast of Mexico. The hurricane \\ncaused widespread destruction in Acapulco and surrounding areas, with economic losses \\nestimated at around US$12 billion.80 At least 48\\xa0deaths were attributed to the hurricane81 with \\na further 32 missing, mostly at sea.\\nThe North Island of New Zealand suffered repeated extreme rainfall and flooding events in \\nJanuary and February. The most significant was on 13–14\\xa0February, when Cyclone Gabrielle  \\npassed just east of the North Island as a post-tropical system. Daily rainfalls exceeded 500\\xa0mm \\nin parts of the eastern North Island and Auckland (971.5\\xa0hPa) had its lowest air pressure on \\nrecord. 11\\xa0deaths were reported because of Gabrielle  and 4 from more localized floods in \\nAuckland on 27–28\\xa0January. Total economic losses from the two events were estimated at \\nUS$5.3 to 8.6 billion82, by far the costliest non-earthquake disaster recorded in New Zealand.\\nMany significant heatwaves occurred in various parts of the world during 2023. Some of the \\nmost significant were in southern Europe and North Africa, especially in the second half of \\nJuly where severe and exceptionally persistent heat occurred. Italy was particularly affected, \\nwith temperatures reaching 48.2\\xa0°C on 24\\xa0July at the Sardinian sites of Lotzorai and Jerzu, \\nonly 0.6 °C below the European record set in Sicily in 2021.83 On 23\\xa0August, a mean daily \\ntemperature of 32.98\\xa0°C was reported at the Brera Observatory in Milan, the highest in a record \\ndating back to\\xa01763. Among the locations experiencing record high temperatures were Tunis \\n(Tunisia) (49.0\\xa0°C on 24\\xa0July), Tirana (Albania) (43.0\\xa0°C on 25\\xa0July), Agadir (Morocco) (50.4\\xa0°C \\non 11\\xa0August), and Algiers (49.2\\xa0°C on 23\\xa0July). The extreme heat shifted to southeast Europe \\nin late July, and there were further heatwaves affecting west-central Europe in late August \\nand early September. Numerous locations in southern France, northern Spain and western \\nSwitzerland set records during these events, including Toulouse (42.4\\xa0°C on 23\\xa0August84). \\nThere was also extensive wildfire activity during the summer, particularly in Greece (both on \\nthe mainland and islands). A fire in north-eastern Greece in late August and early September \\nthat burned 96\\xa0000\\xa0hectares was the largest fire ever observed in the European Union.85\\nCanada’s wildfire season was well beyond any previously recorded. Significant fire activity \\nbegan in late April, expanded during a very warm, dry May, and continued throughout the \\nsummer and into early autumn. The total area burned nationally for the year was 14.9\\xa0million \\nhectares, more than seven times the long-term average (1986–2022) and far above the previous \\nrecord seasonal total of 6.7\\xa0million hectares in 1989 (Figure\\xa024). 297\\xa0evacuation orders were \\n1986     1989       1992      1995      1998      2001      2004      2007      2010       2013      2016      2019       2022\\nYear16\\n14\\n12\\n10\\n86420Area burned (million of hectares)Figure 24.

Four deaths were directly attributed to fires, although \\nthe broader health impacts of the smoke are yet to be fully assessed.\\nThe deadliest single wildfire of the year occurred in Hawaii, on the western side of the island of \\nMaui. Extreme fire weather conditions, with low humidity and strong, gusty winds driven by a \\npressure gradient between strong high pressure to the north and the circulation of Hurricane \\nDora  well to the south, combined with pre-existing drought to favour the development and \\nrapid spread of intense fires. The most affected region was around the town of Lahaina, which \\nwas largely destroyed with over 2\\xa0200\\xa0structures lost. Mandatory evacuation notices were \\nissued for 7\\xa0500 people across the area.88 At least 100\\xa0deaths were reported,89 the most in a \\nwildfire in the United States for more than 100\\xa0years, with 400\\xa0homes destroyed.90 Wildfires \\nof such intensity and speed of movement are extremely rare in the tropics.\\nLong-term drought persisted in north-western Africa and parts of the Iberian Peninsula, as \\nwell as parts of central and southwest Asia, and intensified in many parts of Central America, \\nnorthern South America and the southern United States. Among the most significant areas \\nof drought was an area of subtropical South America, focused on northern Argentina and \\nUruguay. Rainfall from January to August was 20 to 50% below average over much of northern \\nand central Argentina, with some regions experiencing their fourth successive year of signif -\\nicantly below average rainfall. In Uruguay, water storages reached critically low levels, badly \\naffecting the quality of supplies to major centres including Montevideo, although there was \\nsome improvement in the situation from August. Although there was some easing of drought \\nconditions in subtropical South America later in the year, drought intensified in many parts \\nof the continent’s interior, including large parts of the Amazon basin. Eight Brazilian states \\nrecorded their lowest July to September rainfall in over 40\\xa0years. The Rio Negro at Manaus \\nreached a record low (observations started in 1902) level on 26\\xa0October, 0.93\\xa0m below the \\nprevious record set in 2010.91\\nThe Greater Horn of Africa region, which had been experiencing long-term drought, suffered \\nsubstantial flooding in\\xa02023, particularly later in the year following heavy rains associated \\nwith El\\xa0Niño and the positive Indian Ocean Dipole (see Short-term climate drivers ). The most \\nbadly affected area was the region encompassing the southern half of Somalia, southeastern \\nEthiopia and northeastern Kenya. During the Deyr rainy season (October and November), \\nmonthly rainfall in this region was widely 100 to 200\\xa0millimetres and locally exceeded 200 \\nmillimetres, several times the long-term averages. There were at least 352\\xa0deaths reported \\nacross the three countries.92 Across Ethiopia, Burundi, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, \\nSomalia and Kenya, widespread and severe flooding displaced 1.8 million people93 in addition \\nto the 3\\xa0million people displaced internally or across borders by the five consecutive seasons \\nof drought94 in Ethiopia, Kenya, Djibouti, and Somalia. The wet conditions did lead to some \\nrecovery in pasture and crop conditions after the extended drought. Landslides and flooding \\nin early December also resulted in at least 89 deaths in northern parts of the United Republic \\nof Tanzania.95 Pastoralist communities have continued to be affected by asset losses after two \\nconsecutive years of drought.

This \\nis aggravated by the effects of climate and weather extremes. In southern Africa, for example, \\nweather extremes, including the passage of Cyclone Freddy  in February 2023, have affected \\nareas of Madagascar, Mozambique, southern Malawi, and Zimbabwe. Flooding associated \\nwith the cyclone submerged extensive agricultural areas and inflicted severe damage on \\ncrops. This has exacerbated a slow economic recovery.102\\nGlobally, annual economic losses from climate and weather-related disasters have increased \\nsince the 2000s.104 Between 2007 and 2022, 88\\xa0post-disaster needs assessment surveys \\nconducted in 60\\xa0countries worldwide showed that over 65% of losses caused by droughts \\noccurred in the agriculture sector, including crop and livestock production losses. For floods, \\nstorms, and cyclones, around 20% of losses are in agriculture.105\\nIn early 2023, South Sudan continued to experience exceptional flooding, with water levels \\nremaining high even during the dry season. Even with relatively dry conditions locally, \\nflooding persisted due to high flows from further upstream in the Nile basin, and very slow \\ndrainage from earlier floods. The prolonged flooding made it difficult for people to access \\nbasic needs such as food, clean water, and healthcare and contributed to the near collapse \\nof local livelihoods. Between April and July 2023, 7.8\\xa0million people, almost two-thirds of the \\ntotal population in South Sudan, were expected to experience severe acute food insecurity.106\\nAfghanistan experienced a substantial reduction in snowmelt and rainfall, resulting in another \\npoor crop season. This led to widespread acute food insecurity, particularly in the north and \\nnortheastern regions. Between May and October 2023, 15.3\\xa0million Afghanis were estimated \\nto face severe acute food insecurity107. In Yemen, 53% of the population were already classified \\nas in a crisis  level of acute food insecurity or worse between October and December 2022. \\nHigh food and fuel prices, together with floods from March to September 2023, and protracted \\nconflict, have further aggravated food insecurity. \\nIn Indonesia, a meteorological drought linked to El\\xa0Niño and the positive phase of the Indian \\nOcean Dipole (see Short-term climate drivers ) occurred during the dry season, affecting \\n23\\xa0450\\xa0hectares of paddy cultivation, and causing 6\\xa0964\\xa0hectares of crop failure, as of August \\n2023. A decrease of 645\\xa0000\\xa0tonnes of rice production was predicted by October 2023.108 Crop \\nplanting in late 2023 was also delayed. \\nIn 2023, a record maize production in Brazil compensated for below-average harvests \\nelsewhere in South America due to prolonged dry spells, especially in Argentina where \\ndrought conditions are expected to result in a 15% decrease in cereal production compared \\nto the five-year average. The return of El\\xa0Niño in 2023 led to adverse consequences through \\nthe entire crop cycle of maize in Central America and northern parts of South America, \\nwhere water deficits and high temperature have curtailed both planting area and yields with \\ncompounding negative impacts on final production particularly for the small-holders and \\nmore vulnerable households in the Corredor Seco . During the second part of the season, \\ntropical storms and unexpected heavy rain events have disrupted the normal growth of crops \\nin certain areas near the Central America Pacific coast. In Haiti, irregular seasonal rainfall \\nincluding periods of high-intensity precipitation has contributed to decrease the production \\nof primary crops.109\\nOceania is expected to experience the sharpest annual reduction rate on cereal production \\nworldwide, with a 31.1% decline in 2023 compared to 2022, although this largely reflects a \\nreversion to near-average conditions after exceptionally high production in 2022, with 2023 \\nonly slightly below 5-year averages.110Food security28\\nIn September, Storm Daniel brought heavy rainfall to the coastal and northeastern Libya, \\nflooding nearly 3\\xa0000\\xa0hectares of cropland, particularly in the Almarj and Derna regions. \\nThese constitute the main cropland areas in the eastern part of the country and key sources \\nof livelihoods. The collapse of dams in Derna affected the irrigation system and the floods \\naffected many parts of the agrifood value chain, damaging roads, cereal storage, and overall \\nmarket channels. According to the FAO’s Global Information and Early Warning System \\n(GIEWS) Libya was already in a state of food crisis and in need of external assistance in July \\n2023 before the floods.111\\nDISPLACEMENT\\nAcross the globe, millions of people, including internally displaced persons, refugees, and \\nmigrants, are on the move or have been forced to flee their homes and communities because \\nof disasters exacerbated by climate stresses and shocks. Weather hazards continued to trigger \\nnew, prolonged, and secondary displacement in 2023 and increased the vulnerability of many \\nwho were already uprooted by complex multi-causal situations of conflict and violence. \\nThese trends are a clear indication of how vulnerability to climate shocks and stresses is \\nundermining resilience and creating new protection risks, which threaten the achievements \\nof the SDGs. \\nAn estimated 3.4\\xa0million refugees and internally displaced people (IDP) in Syria, Lebanon, \\nJordan, Iraq and Egypt were in need of critical assistance to cope with the extreme winter \\nconditions in 2023.112 In northwestern Syria, snowstorms and floods triggered displacements \\nbetween January and March, many of which were repeated movements of people already \\ndisplaced by the country’s long-running conflict. Similarly, in Yemen, heavy rains hit the \\ncountry in April. Some IDP sites in Marib Governorate were damaged, leaving dozens of \\npeople dead and injured.113\\nMany migrants entering into Somalia found themselves stranded in June and July 2023, mostly \\nin the city of Bossaso, the main coastal crossing location to Yemen, as they were waiting \\nfor more favourable weather conditions to cross the Gulf of Aden. In Hargeisa, a group of \\nmigrants in transition suffered from extreme heat, and some died from dehydration.114\\nIn addition to new displacements caused by high-impact disasters in 2023, many are still \\nenduring the prolonged effects of climate-related displacement that took place in previous \\nyears. In Pakistan, the 2022 monsoon floods, which triggered the largest disaster displacement \\nevent in a decade, continued to have longstanding impacts in 2023. Displaced communities \\nwere still recovering when heavy rains hit some districts in June 2023, causing waterborne \\nand vector-borne diseases.115 \\nDisplacement in the context of climate change and environmental degradation is often \\nmulticausal. Most people move due to a combination of social, political, economic, envi -\\nronmental, and demographic drivers, all of which are and will be affected by climate and \\nenvironmental change. In Somalia alone, some 531\\xa0000 displacements were recorded related \\nto the ongoing drought in 2023 in addition to 653\\xa0000 displacements primarily caused by \\nconflict.116 Subsequent flooding during the October to December rainy season affected more \\nthan 2.4\\xa0million individuals, displacing more than a million people.117 Displacement estimates \\nfor Storm Daniel indicate close to 45 \\xa0000 individuals displaced in northeastern Libya.118 \\nAdditionally, a substantial number of migrants were reported to be living in a low-lying area \\nadjacent to the valley, raising concerns that the floods may have destroyed many of their \\nsettlements with significant loss of life.119 Displacement29\\nClimate related shocks and stresses in migration and displacement contexts affect people’s \\nlivelihoods which entrenches poverty (SDG\\xa01) and hunger (SDG\\xa02), pose direct threats to \\ntheir lives and well-being (SDG\\xa03), widen inequality gaps (SDG\\xa010), limit access to quality \\neducation (SDG\\xa04), water and sanitation (SDG\\xa06) as well as clean energy (SDG\\xa07). Women and \\ngirls are among the worst affected (SDG\\xa05) due to pre-existing gender and socio-economic \\ninequalities compounding their vulnerabilities.120\\nTo better prepare for these contexts, governments, communities, civil society, and the UN \\nare engaged at all levels to strengthen climate resilience and effective disaster risk reduction. \\nA main priority is the community level, where preparedness efforts including early warning \\nsystems and emergency preparedness are picking up pace.121 With 126\\xa0countries in possession \\nof disaster risk management strategies and a total of 99 countries reporting to have local \\ngovernments with disaster risk reduction strategies, development and implementation of local \\ndisaster risk reduction strategies have increased since the adoption of the Sendai Framework \\nfor Disaster Risk Reduction in 2015.122\\nOne of the essential components for reducing the impact of disasters is to have effective \\nmulti-hazard early warning systems, and to have effective systems in place for generating \\ndisaster risk information, creating early warnings, and disseminating them, as well as having \\nplans to act on the warnings. As of 2023, 102 countries have reported having multi-hazard early \\nwarning systems in place, more than half of the countries in the world. The Early Warnings \\nfor All initiative was launched by the UN Secretary-General in March 2022 with the aim of \\nensuring that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events \\nthrough life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027.DisplacementThe State of Climate Finance \\nClimate Policy Initiative\\nIn 2021/2022, 1 global climate flows reached almost USD 1.3 trillion, nearly doubling com -\\npared to 2019/2020 levels.  This increase was primarily driven by a significant acceleration \\nin mitigation finance, up by USD 439 billion from 2019/2020. The remainder of the observed \\ngrowth in 2021/2022 stems from methodological improvements to, and additional data sources \\nused in, the Global Landscape of Climate Finance . Despite this growing momentum in climate \\nfinance, tracked flows represent only approximately 1% of global GDP.\\nComparing tracked climate finance flows to estimated climate finance needs exposes a \\nlarge financing gap.  In an average scenario,2 for a 1.5°C pathway, annual climate finance \\ninvestments need to grow by more than six times, reaching almost USD 9 trillion by 2030 \\nand a further USD 10 trillion through to 2050. \\nDespite the large financing gap, the cost of inaction 3 is even higher.  Aggregating over the \\nperiod 2025-2100, the total cost of inaction is estimated at USD 1,266 trillion; that is, the \\ndifference in losses under a business-as-usual scenario4 and those incurred within a 1.5°C \\npathway. This figure is, however, likely to be a dramatic underestimate of the true cost of \\ninaction, since it does not capture losses to nature and biodiversity, and those induced by \\nconflict and migration, among others. Indeed, the cost of inaction only promises to rise with \\ninsufficient mitigation and inadequate adaptation. \\nDisaggregating global climate finance flows reveals that growth is neither sufficient nor \\nconsistent across sectors and regions.  The growth in global climate finance in 2021/2022 \\nlargely stemmed from significant increases in clean energy investments in only a handful of \\ngeographies; China, the USA, Europe, Brazil, Japan and India together received 90% of the \\nincrease in funds. Other regions, including many climate-vulnerable countries, and other \\nimportant sectors – for example, agriculture  and industry – are being left behind, receiving \\nlittle finance that is disproportionately low given their significant mitigation potential. In \\naddition, emerging mitigation technologies, including battery storage and hydrogen, are \\nonly beginning to attract private finance and yet to be scaled-up. \\nOf particular concern, adaptation finance continues to lag.  Though adaptation finance \\nreached an all-time high of USD 63 billion in 2021/2022, the global adaptation financing gap \\nis widening, falling well short of the estimated USD 212 billion per year needed up to 2030 \\nin developing countries alone. Tracked adaptation finance remains dominated by public \\nactors (98%) while tracking challenges continue to impede a clear picture of adaptation \\n1 CPI reports a biennial average to smooth out fluctuations in the (annual) data.\\n2 Climate finance needs are estimated as a range, including lower bound, upper bound, and average needs, based on direct \\ninvestments in climate-specific physical assets and excluding transition-related unabated fossil fue finance.\\n3 Failure to stay within a 1.5°C pathway; for further details see CPI, 2024.

The majority of adaptation finance is directed to the water and \\nwastewater sector, reflecting efforts to build resilience to water stress, while other sectors \\nwith wide-ranging adaptation potential – for example, agriculture  – continue to receive only \\nminimal finance. Mainstreaming adaptation and resilience into development pathways is \\nimperative, particularly in highly vulnerable developing countries. \\nMoving forward, all actors must urgently work to scale the quantity and quality of climate \\nfinance.  Key priorities for ensuring more and better climate finance include: transforming \\nthe financial system with an emphasis on concessional financing and de-risking; bridging \\nclimate and development needs , harnessing synergies to deliver co-benefits for both people \\nand nature; mobilizing domestic capital , with an emphasis on enabling policies and regulatory \\nframeworks; and  improving the availability and accessibility of quality, granular data  to measure \\nand manage progress. \\nUSD billion\\nClimate ﬁnance\\n2011–2012                   2021–2022                2030                                                                       205012,000\\n10,000\\n8,0006,0004,0002,000\\n0Range of\\nestimated needsNeeds in the average scenario\\n12,227\\n10,7699,44112,012\\n8,9765,905\\n1,265\\n364\\nYear\\nFigure 26.

In 2021, \\nthe\\xa0IPCC AR6 WG I assessed change from 1850–1900 to other periods based on an average \\nof four data sets – HadCRUT5, Berkeley Earth, NOAA Interim and Kadow et al. (2020) – which \\nstart in 1850 and are globally or near-globally complete in the modern period.\\nTo include shorter data sets, which can help to better understand recent temperature changes, \\nin the present report, the estimate made by the IPCC for the temperature change between \\n1850–1900 and 1981–2010 is combined with estimated changes between 1981–2010 and the \\ncurrent year from six data sets to calculate anomalies for 2023 relative to 1850–1900. There \\nis good agreement between the data sets on changes from 1981–2010 to the present, as this \\nis a period with good observational coverage.\\nThe additional uncertainty from the spread of the data sets is combined with that of the \\nIPCC’s estimate of the uncertainty in the change from 1850–1900 to 1981–2010. Global mean \\ntemperature anomalies were calculated relative to an 1850–1900 baseline using the following \\nsteps starting from time series of global monthly mean temperatures for each data set:\\n1. For each data set, anomalies were calculated relative to the 1981–2010 average by\\xa0subtracting \\nthe mean for the period 1981–2010 for each month separately.\\n2. An annual mean anomaly was calculated from the monthly mean anomalies.\\n3. The amount of 0.69 °C was added to each series, based on the estimated difference \\nbetween 1850–1900 and 1981–2010, calculated using the method from IPCC AR6 WG I \\n(see caption for Figure\\xa01.12 in that report).\\n4. The mean and standard deviation of the estimates were calculated.\\n5. The uncertainty in the IPCC estimate was combined with the standard deviation, assuming \\nthe two are independent and assuming the IPCC uncertainty range (0.54 °C to 0.79 °C) is \\nrepresentative of a 90% confidence range (1.645 standard deviations).\\nThe number quoted in this report for 2023 (1.45 ± 0.12 °C) was calculated in this way with\\xa01.45\\xa0°C \\nbeing the mean of the seven estimates and 0.03 °C the standard deviation.Data sets and methods33\\nANNUAL TEMPERATURE MAPS\\nFor the map of temperature anomalies for 2023, a median of six data sets was used, regridded \\nto the spatial grid of the lowest resolution data sets (NOAAGlobalTemp, and HadCRUT5), \\nwhich are presented on a 5° latitude by 5° longitude grid. The median is used in preference \\nto the mean to minimize the effect of potential outliers in individual grid cells. The half-range \\nof the data sets provides an indication of the uncertainty. The spread between the data sets \\nis largest at high latitudes and in Central Africa, both regions with sparse data coverage.\\nGLOBAL MEAN TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES FOR 2023 RELATIVE TO OTHER PERIODS\\nThis table shows global mean temperature anomalies for individual data sets for 2023 relative \\nto four different baselines. The uncertainty indicated for the three modern baselines (1981–2010, \\n1991–2020 and 1961–1990) are the standard deviations of the available estimates multiplied \\nby 1.645 to represent the 90% uncertainty range.\\nPeriod 1850–1900 1981–2010 1991–2020 1961–1990\\nHadCRUT5 1.44 0.75 0.56 1.09\\nNOAA GlobalTemp 1.43 0.75 0.55 1.05\\nGISTEMP 1.44 0.75 0.56 1.07\\nBerkeley Earth 1.45 0.75 0.57 1.12\\nERA5 1.48 0.79 0.60 1.12\\nJRA-55 1.43 0.74 0.56 1.09\\nMean of six datasets 1.45±0.12 0.76±0.03 0.57±0.03 1.09±0.04\\nThe following six data sets were used, including four traditional datasets:\\nHadCRUT.5.0.1.0: Morice, C.

MCS categories are analogous but counting days below the \\ntenth percentile, except for the “ice” category. This category is given to any MCS when the \\nthreshold for the occurrence on any given day of the event is below –1.7°C (Schlegel et la., \\n2021). These are therefore considered to be conditions related to sea-ice, and not extreme \\ntemperature fluctuations.\\nThe baseline used for MHWs and MCSs is 1982–2011, which is shifted by one year from the  \\nstandard normal period of 1981–2010 because the first full year of the satellite SST series on which  \\nit is based is 1982. This period has not been updated to the current standard normal period \\nof 1991–2020 because the shifting of the baseline has a significant effect on the results and \\nwould not allow for comparison of MHW/MCS statistics with previous versions of this report.\\nAll MHWs and MCSs are detected using the NOAA daily Optimum Interpolation Sea-Surface \\nTemperature (OISST) v2.1 dataset (Huang et al. 2021).\\nHobday, A.

The GRACE/GRACE-FO data are corrected for the \\nlong-term trend of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) from the solid earth using the regional \\nIJ05 R2 GIA model (Ivins et al., 2013) over Antarctica and the regional Simpson et al.
